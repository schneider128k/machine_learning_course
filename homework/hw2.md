HW 2

The goal of this homework is to create a convolutional neural network for the CIFAR10 data set. 
See [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LZZviWOzvchcXRdZi2IBx3KOpQOzLalf) how to load the CIFAR data in Keras.

Make sure that the data is divided into: 

- training set, 
- validation set 
- test set. 

Use the training set to train your neural networks. Evaluate their performance on the validation data set. 

After trying several different architectures, choose the one that performs
best of the validation set. 

Train this final architecture on the data from the training set and validation set and evaluate its performance on 
the test set.
